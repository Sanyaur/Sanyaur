👋 Hi, I’m Sandor, currently a **Frontend Developer** with 1+ year experience, and looking forward to work in 
**React** ⚛ projects, and making fun with **Python** 🐍 automation with **Selenium Webdriver**.

👀 You can already find some of my projects in my Github written in **React**, **Python** and 
vanilla **Javascript** (and some HTML content written with **Bootstrap**)
