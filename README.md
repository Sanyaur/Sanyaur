👋 Hi, I’m Sandor, currently a **Junior level Frontend Developer** looking forward to work in 
**React** projects, and making fun with **Python** automation with **Selenium Webdriver**.

👀 You can already find some of my projects in my Github written in **React**, **Python** and 
vanilla **Javascript** (and some HTML content written with **Bootstrap**)
